WELCOME TO JEOPARDY!

This game is the first project for my Web Development Immersive class at General Assembly. The assignment was to make a simple game, so I chose my favorite evening program starring Alex Trebek: Jeopardy! The rules are to run through each value tile to increase your score. To get the answers right, you must start each with 'WHAT IS' and not use any punctuation.

The focus of this project was to practice some fundamental skills we have learned so far in the program. Below is a list of these technologies that are utilized in this project:

-HTML5
-CSS3
-SCSS
-JavaScript
-Yeoman Scaffolding
-Grunt task runner
-Bower Package Manager
-jQuery
-Git

I hope you enjoy testing your knowledge of each category. I intend to continue this game development to make the best product I can.
